# Serving ML Model via Flask

## Flaskrml

Demonstrating how to serve ML models via REST using flask 

## Setting up the Backend

### Install Dependencies

1. **Python 3.10** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

2. **Virtual Environment** - Recommend working within a virtual environment . This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Key Pip Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [Trax](https://github.com/google/trax) Trax is an end-to-end library for deep learning that focuses on clear code and speed. I

- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) An end-to-end machine learning platform

- [jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html) JAX is NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for high-performance machine learning research.
